    "descriptions": "JENNIFER ANISTON SUPERFANS presented by HOUSE OF KILLING feat Esben Holk, 2018 onwards. JENNIFER ANISTON SUPERFANS is an ongoing research project. It uses a preconceived fandom of Jennifer Aniston as basis for the continuous production and dissemination of semi real and unreal content. It becomes an intervention in algorithmic content redistribution: trolling the surveillance apparatus by subverting the search for meaning and adopting connotational cultural reference into the production of uncertainty. Jennifer Aniston as medium is invited to occupy digital space and to become, for a growing group of artists and other practitioners, the posthuman cyborgian hybrid of content, medium, platform and content generator. The superfans in the art project and on the facebook-group number almost 630 people, and include IRL art collaborations with work by Maansi Jain, Cara Lien, Sean Pinearo, Sophie Harkins and Jens Lovgren. With tarotcards, spiritual readings, lifecoaching, video, performance and installation: The superfans are creating mythology!",
